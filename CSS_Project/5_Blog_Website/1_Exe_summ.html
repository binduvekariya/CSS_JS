                    An executive summary of a business plan is an overview. Its purpose is to summarize the key points
                    of a document for its readers, saving them time and preparing them for the upcoming content. <br>
                    <br>

                    Think of the executive summary as an advance organizer for the reader. Above all else, it must be
                    clear and concise. But it also has to entice the reader to read the rest of the business plan.1

                    <br><br>

                    This is why the executive summary is often called the most important part of the business plan. If
                    it doesn’t capture the reader's attention, the plan will be set aside unread—a disaster if you've
                    written your business plan as part of an attempt to get money to start your new business.2 (Getting
                    startup money is not the only reason to write a business plan; there are other just-as-important
                    reasons.) <br><br>

                    <h3>Note</h3>
                    <p>Because it is an overview of the entire plan, it is common to write the executive summary last
                        (and writing it last can make it much easier).</p>

                <h2>What Information Goes in an Executive Summary?</h2>
                <p>
                    The information you need to include varies somewhat depending on whether your business is a startup
                    or an established business. <br> <br>

                    For a startup business typically one of the main goals of the business plan is to convince banks,
                    angel investors, or venture capitalists to invest in your business by providing startup capital in
                    the form of debt or equity financing.34 <br> <br>

                    In order to do so you will have to provide a solid case for your business idea which makes your
                    executive summary all the more important. A typical executive summary for a startup company includes
                    the following sections: <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The business opportunity. Describe the need or the opportunity. </li> <br>
                    <li> Taking advantage of the opportunity. Explain how will your business will serve the market.
                    </li><br>
                    <li> The target market. Describe the customer base you will be targeting. </li> <br>
                    <li> Business model. Describe your products or services and and what will make them appealing to the
                        target market.</li> <br>
                    <li> Marketing and sales strategy. Briefly outline your plans for marketing your products and
                        services.</li> <br>
                    <li> The competition. Describe your competition and your strategy for getting market share. What is
                        your competitive advantage, e.g. what will you offer to customers that your competitors cannot?
                    </li> <br>
                    <li> Financial analysis. Summarize the financial plan including projections for at least the next
                        three years. </li> <br>
                    <li> Owners/Staff. Describe the owners and the key staff members and the expertise they bring to the
                        venture.</li> <br>
                    <li> Implementation plan. Outline the schedule for taking your business from the planning stage to
                        opening your doors.</li> <br>
                </ul>

                    <p>An executive summary provides an overview of a larger document or research and is usually the
                        first thing your reader will see. Oftentimes, executive summaries are the only place decision
                        makers will go to determine if action is warranted on a particular action or idea.</p>
